# TerrorWear

TerrorWear is my modular Wear OS sandbox, which has small games, device tools, and experimental features like camera remote control and program assist.

I built it around my smartwatch (Samsung Galaxy Watch5 pro), because... \
...I like programming, \
...wanted to learn how to use android studio and \
...wanted to get more out of my smartwatch.

## Features
- **Modular architecture**: each feature is isolated from the rest.
- **Miniature games**: Pong, Tilt and more
- **Device tools**: camera remote, program assist, BLE utilities
- **Connectivity experiments**: BLE, Wi‑Fi, sensors, and communication with other devices
- **Using Wear OS native interface**: ScalingLazyColumn, ToggleChips, haptics, round‑screen layouts, etc.

## What it uses
- [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/)
- [Compose for Wear OS](https://developer.android.com/training/wearables/compose?version=3)
- Data saving: [Room](https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/room) and [DataStore](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/releases/datastore)
- Custom BLE stack
- <details><summary>AppContainer-based DI (to keep it simple)</summary>

  - A single DI entry point (AppContainer)
  - Features pull dependencies from that one container
  - Modules don’t construct dependencies themselves
  - There is no per-feature DI graph, compared to a tool like Hilt

## Installation
1. The target device must have developer settings enabled.
2. Load this project in Android Studio.
3. Pair your device to Android Studio.
4. Build the project, this will automatically install it on your device.
5. ???
6. Profit.

## Modes

### Program Assist
A multi‑purpose companion mode for interacting with your laptop.
Handles BLE/Wi‑Fi session pairing, gesture input, and remote actions.
The presenter feature will live here since it assumes an active desktop session.

### Camera Remote
Controls the paired phone’s camera.
Supports shutter, preview toggles, and basic remote actions over BLE/Wi‑Fi.

### Compass
Simple directional tool that uses the magnetometer and IMU fusion.
Neat for quick orientation checks.

### Pong
A little minimalist wrist‑controlled Pong.
It uses swipe gestures (in the future tilt input aswell), and haptics for feedback.

### Table Tilt
A physics‑based tilt game using accelerometer data.
You move the ball by rotating your wrist, and try to survive for as long as possible whilst dodging obstacles.

### HD2 Stratagem
A Wear OS adaptation of the Helldivers 2 stratagem input system.
Pair to your desktop, then use directional gesture sequences to input stratagem codes.

### Bluetooth LE
Raw GATT inspector and packet monitor.
Useful for testing your custom BLE stack.

### Wi-Fi

### Inertial Measurement Unit
The IMU exposes accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer data. With sensor fusion, this produces a (mostly) stable 3D orientation reference.

This debugging module shows a live IMU readout. I use it to test sensor accuracy and to debug gesture input, orientation tracking, and fusion behavior.

## The Bluetooth Low Energy stack
TerrorWear uses a small, custom BLE stack which is built around Android’s GATT APIs.

It handles scanning, connecting, service discovery, reads, writes, and notifications without relying on any external libraries.

The goal is to keep things predictable. There is one client, one connection flow, and there are clear domain models instead of dealing with Android's raw types.

It’s built for quick experiments, like sending commands to my laptop or Arduino, and pairing with my desktop for Program Assist and Stratagem input.
